# Jagger Roadmap

Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and display meaningful error messages to the user when something goes wrong.
Provide a mechanism to log errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.
Styling and Theming:

Allow users to customize the appearance of the application by providing options for theming, setting custom stylesheets, or integrating with popular GUI design libraries like Qt Designer.
Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

Support internationalization and localization by providing mechanisms to translate the application's user interface into different languages.
Data Validation:

Implement data validation mechanisms to validate user input, ensuring that it meets specific criteria before processing it.
Persistent Settings:

Allow users to save and load application settings, such as window positions, size, and other user preferences, between sessions.
Data Persistence:

Add support for data storage and retrieval, allowing the application to save and load data to and from databases, files, or external services.
Menu and Toolbar Management:

Provide mechanisms for creating and managing menus and toolbars in your application, allowing users to access various functionalities easily.
Dialog Boxes:

Implement custom dialog boxes (e.g., QMessageBox, QInputDialog) to prompt users for input or display informative messages.
Tabbed Views:

Enable multiple views to be displayed within a tabbed interface, allowing users to switch between different views easily.
Tooltips and Help Documentation:

Add tooltips to widgets to provide users with additional information when they hover over elements.
Include built-in or external help documentation to assist users in understanding how to use the application.
Drag and Drop Support:
Allow users to drag and drop items within the application, enabling more intuitive interactions for specific use cases.
Context Menus:
Implement context menus (right-click menus) for widgets to provide additional options or actions based on the context of user interactions.
Application Updates:
Add functionality to check for updates to the application and prompt users to install new versions when available.
Keyboard Shortcuts:
Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions in the application, providing power users with quicker access to functionalities.
Data Binding:
Implement data binding mechanisms to automatically update widgets when underlying data changes and vice versa.
These are just some ideas to expand the Jagger framework's capabilities. Depending on your application's specific requirements and intended use cases, you can choose which functionalities to add to enhance the overall user experience and development flexibility.
